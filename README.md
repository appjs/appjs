# AppJS

AppJS is an SDK to develop desktop applications using node. Or at least
it is going to be!

The goal is to facilitate native app development using
tools every developer is familiar with nowadays: HTML/CSS/JS

**Attention:** AppJS is under heavy development. API changes a lot until we bump version to v0.1.0

## How to install

** Only Linux and Windows ports work for now. Pull requests for Mac OS are very welcome **

Using npm:

    $ npm install appjs

Using git:

    $ git clone https://github.com/milani/appjs
    $ cd appjs
    $ npm install -d

### Windows users

You should copy all shared libraries ( .dll files ) located at `appjs/deps/cef/Release`
to current working directory or AppJS fails to run with error: module not found.

### Ubuntu users

If `npm install appjs` fails with `Package ... was not found`, please `apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev` first.

## How to use

There is a complete example in the `examples/` folder.

Here is a simple one:

	var appjs = require('appjs');

	var window;

	// Initialize appjs.
    var app = appjs.init();

    // Called when page load finishes.
    app.on("ready",function(){
	  console.log("Event Ready called");

	  // Runs a script in browser context.
	  window.runInBrowser(function(){
	    var body = document.body;
	    body.style.color="#f60";
	  });

	  // Show created window ( see below )
	  window.show();
	});

	// Routing:

	// you can use a static router:
	// app.use(app.staticRouter('./public'));

	// or you can handle requests manually:
	app.get("/",function(req,res,next){
	  res.send("\
	  	<html>\
	  		<head><title>Hello World</title></head>\
	  		<body>Hello World</body>\
	  	</html>\
	  ")
	});

	// Creates a new window. Its invisible until window.show() get called.
    window = app.createWindow("appjs://app/",{autoResize:false});
